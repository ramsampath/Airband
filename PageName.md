# Issues #

**time/progress of song is missing?  it would also be nice to have
min:sec remaining**

**the volume knob is _confusing_ -- i think either needs a simple
left is quiet / right loud zone approach or at least a bigger
indicator and perhaps a 0-100 text in the middle.  another choice
would make it snap to the -/+ indicators and have them hilight when
they are hit.**

**now playing rev/play/fwd buttons don't match their background plus
their overall layout is a bit awkward -- there are too many buttons in
that top row.**

**each screen should be cleared out when the selection changes -- i
believe this just involves clearing out the appropriate data structure
in appdata.**

**busy indicator needed when moving screen to screen that have downloads**

**search leaves section headers w/ no entries -- so if the 'B' section
has no results the bar shouldn't show up**

**a-z slider still hilights as grey;  maybe a bkgrnd or selected
property can change that.**

**the album page might have #songs listed**
